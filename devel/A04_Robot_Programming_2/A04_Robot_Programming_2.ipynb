    "# Robot Programming 2: Finite State Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "Robots that have complex repertoires of behavior need an overall governing structure that permits them to react to their environments appropriately. This can mean many different things, but in the case of the Romi robot, which is equipped with two wheels, a manipulator arm, and a proximity sensor, \"react to the environment appropriately\" might mean exploring the environment, seeking out certain objects, picking them up, and placing them in an appropriate secondary location. Maybe the Romi is picking weeds as part of a robotic farming application. Maybe it represents a mining robot, or a \"search and rescue\" robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever the case may be, the tasks that a robot like Romi can execute have to be coordinated according to what is happening around it. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will develop a system called a Finite State Machine to program the Romi to explore its environment without running into obstacles. We will save more complex behaviors for another time, but learning to coordinate Romi's behavior using a Finite State machine will set you up well for later assignments in this course."

    "This assignment world features two Romi robots. One has a bright LED attached to it, and it executes a simple \"explorer\" FSM, similar to the one we built as a class exercise. This is the \"leader\" Romi (shown left in image). The other Romi, the \"follower\" Romi (shown right in image), has two additional sensors added to it. The \"light sensors\" on the follower Romi, shown as yellow rays in the image above, return values from 0 to 1000, allowing you to compare their readings to determine whether the leader romi is to the follower's right, or left. Both Romis are equipped with the same distance sensor as the physical Romis we have in the ES302 lab, attached to the bottom of the gripper assembly. The rays from those sensors are shown in red/green in the image above.\n",

    "## Challenge\n",

    "Your challenge for this assignment is to create and implement a FSM for the follower Romi that:\n",
    "1. Allows the follower to maintain a distance of less than 0.35 meters between it and the \"leader\" Romi at steady state (roughly 2 minutes of simulation should be plenty to observe steady state). \n",
    "2. Avoids the robots becoming tangled or stuck. \"Stuck\" means that the two Romis are motionless (no turns or translation) for more than 10 seconds at a time. Small, brief tangles are likely inevitable.\n",

    "Exactly what approach you take to this FSM design is up to you. A short animation showing the type of behavior your FSM could manifest with an acceptable solution is shown below. Note that inside this animation, you can left-click to rotate the view, scroll to zoom, or right click to pan."

Scope the model you're using in your approach-- here, \"scope\" means that you are explicitly calling out the boundary of the \"model\" you're using, and naming its \"ins\" (sources of energy, information, etc.), \"outs\" (ways in which the system exchanges energy or information with its environment), and \"stored\" quantities (what the system accumulates in terms of energy or information). \n",
