    "# Background Resources\n",

    "## Textbook\n",
    "\n",
    "In ES302, we will be leaning heavily on reading assignments from [An Introduction to Autonomous Robots](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Autonomous-Robots/Introduction-to-Autonomous-Robots/blob/master/book-12-01-21-full.pdf) by Nikolaus Correll. The book is free to download at the link above, but it is also open source, with updates submitted often to the book's [Github repository](https://github.com/Introduction-to-Autonomous-Robots/Introduction-to-Autonomous-Robots). A Git repository is a complete record of a textfile-based project (such as code or a book) that includes its entire revision history. We will learn more about Git as a way to organize your work as the semester progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supplemental Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The textbook, like all textbooks, won't cover everything we need in the proper amount of detail. I will be releasing supplemental material in the form of webpages (based on the Jupyter notebook platform) that cover course concepts that don't receive a sufficient treatment in the text. An example is the [Romi Resource](../02_Romi_Resources/02A_Romi_Resource.ipynb), which introduces you to the robot we'll be using for class exercises and homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling of Physical Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In ES302, you will need a basic understanding of how interconnected systems of electrical, mechanical, and fluid systems (among others) can be modeled using differential equations. You can find a full set of course notes for ES103, which covers this type of modeling, at [this link](https://alexanderallenbrown.github.io/ES103_SP22_Students). You can also find an abridged version of the course content in [this document](./01B_ES103_Summary_Resource.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "ES302 also requires a basic proficiency in writing code to analyze data and direct/interact with robots and their environment. You should already be familiar with basic programming concepts, and with the [MATLAB/Octave](https://alexanderallenbrown.github.io/ES103_SP22_Students/Programming_Resource/Programming_Resource.html) language. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, interacting with robots will require you to build on your prior programming skills. In ES302, we will build bridges between robots and computers using the Python programming language. A quick introduction to Python is given in [this document](./01C_Python_Resource.ipynb). We will also do a bit of robot programming using the Arduino language. A quick introduction to the Arduino language is given in [this document](./01D_Arduino_resource.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematics\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will require a basic understanding of Calculus 1 through calculus 3, along with differential equations, and a bit of linear algebra. There are appendices to the textbook that cover most of what you'll need!"
